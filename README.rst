Code and Examples from Benjamin Pierce's "`Types and Programming Languages`_".

Overview
========

"`Types and Programming Languages`_" provides a comprehensive introduction to type systems and programming language theory. The code which accompanies the book is written in OCaml; this repository contains an F# port of that code.

**NOTE:** The ported F# code is not a fresh implementation -- it is the *original* OCaml code with some trivial modifications which allow it to compile with F#. The output of each of the F# projects has been verified to match the `output of the original OCaml programs`_.

Prerequisites
=============

- F# compiler

  - Windows

    - Visual Studio 2010 or 2012

  - Mac OS X / FreeBSD / Linux

    - Mono 3.0 (or newer)
    - `fsharp 3.0`_
    - MonoDevelop 3.0 (or newer)

      - fsharpbinding_
  
- NuGet_ is used to manage external packages. The easiest way to `install NuGet`_ is by downloading it (for free) from the `Visual Studio Extension Gallery`_. If you do not have NuGet, or are running a version prior to 2.5, you *must* install it (or upgrade) before you will be able to build the projects.

  The solution uses the *Package Restore* feature of NuGet to automatically download any missing packages when the project is built. This requires that you have the `Allow NuGet to download missing packages during build`_ setting enabled; in Visual Studio, you can find the setting under ``Options -> Package Manager -> General``.

  Once NuGet is installed and configured, you should be able to build the solution.

- `F# PowerPack 2.0`_ (GitHub_)

  The F# PowerPack 2.0 is required (for now) because the projects use ``fslex`` and ``fsyacc``. If you're running Windows, you should install the PowerPack from the installer on CodePlex (link above); otherwise, build and install the sources from the GitHub repository.

  On a related note, I'm working on replacements for ``fslex`` and ``fsyacc`` (see my `fsharp-tools`_ repository); they're not quite ready to use yet, but once they are I'll modify the TAPL projects to use my replacements (``fsharplex`` and ``fsharpyacc``) instead.
